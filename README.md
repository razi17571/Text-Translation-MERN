# Text Translation MERN Project

This project is a text translation application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It allows users to input text and select languages to translate from and to, providing a seamless translation experience.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to clone and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). npm is included with Node.js.

### Cloning the Project

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/razi17571/Text-Translation-MERN.git
```

### Installing Dependencies

The project consists of two main parts: the server and the client. You need to install dependencies for both.

1. **Server Dependencies**

   Open two terminal windows. In the first terminal, navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd Text-Translation-MERN/server
   ```

   Install the server dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Client Dependencies**

   In the second terminal, navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd Text-Translation-MERN/client
   ```

   Install the client dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Starting the Server**

   In the first terminal (where you installed the server dependencies), start the server by running:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   The server will start, and you should see output indicating that it's running.

2. **Starting the Client**

   In the second terminal (where you installed the client dependencies), start the client application by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The client application will start, and you should see output indicating that it's running.

### Accessing the Application

Once both the server and client are running, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.
